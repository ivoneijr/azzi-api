You are an expert in TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, NestJS, Prisma, BullMQ, Next.js, React.js, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, TailwindCSS, AWS (SNS, S3, Amplify), Stripe, Zustand, Sentry, New Relic, Docker, PostgreSQL, and Redis. You have extensive experience with RESTful API development and deployment on Heroku.

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript and JavaScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Structure files appropriately:
  - Backend: controllers, services, modules, DTOs, entities, and interfaces.
  - Frontend: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `services/user-service`, `components/auth-wizard`).
- Favor named exports for modules, services, and components.

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

## Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX where applicable.

## Backend Specifics

- **Database and ORM**: Use Prisma for database interactions with clear and concise Prisma schemas. Use TypeScript interfaces for Prisma models.
- **Queue Management**: Use BullMQ for queue management. Define and document job processors and queues clearly.
- **Email Services**: Use Resend and React Email for email functionalities. Define email templates and services clearly.
- **AWS Services**: Use AWS SNS for notifications and S3 for storage. Implement secure and efficient AWS interactions.
- **Payment Processing**: Use Stripe for payment processing. Securely handle payment data and implement Stripe's best practices.
- **Error Tracking and Performance Monitoring**: Use Sentry for error tracking and New Relic for performance monitoring. Implement clear and actionable logging.
- **Containerization**: Use Docker for containerization. Define clear and concise Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations.

## Frontend Specifics

- **UI and Styling**: Use Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and TailwindCSS for components and styling. Implement responsive design with TailwindCSS using a mobile-first approach.
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for state management. Prefer local component state for simple state needs.
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize `use client`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor React Server Components (RSC). Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback. Use dynamic loading for non-critical components. Optimize images by using WebP format, including size data, and implementing lazy loading.

## Monorepo Management

- We are using a monorepo to manage both the backend and frontend projects.
- Use `pnpm` workspaces to manage dependencies and run scripts across projects.
- Ensure shared configurations and utilities are placed in a dedicated shared package within the monorepo.
- Maintain consistency across both projects by centralizing configurations like linting, formatting, and environment settings at the root level of the monorepo.
- Use `concurrently` to run both backend and frontend projects simultaneously during development.

## Key Conventions

- **API Performance**: Optimize API performance and scalability.
- **Secure Coding**: Ensure secure coding practices.
- **Containerization**: Use Docker for containerization with clear configurations.
- **Web Vitals**: Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- **Limit `use client`**: Favor server components and Next.js SSR. Use `use client` only for Web API access in small components and avoid it for data fetching or state management.

Follow best practices and guidelines from:

- **NestJS docs** for backend development.
- **Next.js docs** for data fetching, rendering, and routing on the frontend.
